  # 🚦 Traffic Pattern Analysis

##  Problem Statement

Cities often face traffic congestion due to poor understanding of traffic flow patterns. This project analyzes vehicle count/GPS data to identify peak traffic hours, trends, and anomalies, providing insights for better city planning and traffic management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify peak traffic hours.  
- Detect anomalies such as sudden spikes/drops. 
- Visualize traffic trends using graphs and heatmaps.
- (Optional) Predict future traffic trends using regression/time-series analysis.  
- Generate a summary report for city planning.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset contains:

- `Date` Date of observation
- `Hour` Hour of the day (0–23) 
- `Vehicle_Count` Number of vehicles recorded during that hour
Example row:
```bash
2025-08-01, 08, 240
```

 
## Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**

- **Pandas** → Data manipulation

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Visualization

- **Scikit-learn** → Regression & prediction

- **Colab/Jupyter Notebook** → Development environment

## How to Run

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hariharan-T27/traffic-flow-insights.git
cd Traffic-Pattern-Analysis

```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run Jupyter/Colab Notebook
- Open `notebooks/` in Jupyter or Google Colab.

- Run step-by-step analysis (exploration → visualization → anomaly detection → prediction).

## Sample Results
- Morning peak traffic between 7–9 AM.

- Evening peak traffic between 5–7 PM.

- Weekends show 30–40% lower traffic.



## Expected Outcomes
- Graphs showing traffic density over time.

- Bar charts & heatmaps of average traffic by hour/day.

- Anomaly detection report.

- Predictive model for future traffic trends.
